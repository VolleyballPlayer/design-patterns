<h1><span class="section-number">1.7. </span>Bridge<a class="headerlink" href="#bridge" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.</p>
<p>Usage examples: The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)</p>
<p>Identification: Bridge can be recognized by a clear distinction between some controlling entity and several different platforms that it relies on.</p>
<p><strong>:( Problem</strong></p>
<p>Say you have a geometric Shape class with a pair of subclasses: Circle and Square. You want to extend this class hierarchy to incorporate colors, so you plan to create Red and Blue shape subclasses. However, since you already have two subclasses, you’ll need to create four class combinations such as BlueCircle and RedSquare.</p>
<p>Adding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially. For example, to add a triangle shape you’d need to introduce two subclasses, one for each color. And after that, adding a new color would require creating three subclasses, one for each shape type. The further we go, the worse it becomes.</p>
<p><strong>:) Solution</strong></p>
<p>This problem occurs because we’re trying to extend the shape classes in two independent dimensions: by form and by color. That’s a very common issue with class inheritance.</p>
<p>The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching from inheritance to the object composition. What this means is that you extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class.</p>
<p>Following this approach, we can extract the color-related code into its own class with two subclasses: Red and Blue. The Shape class then gets a reference field pointing to one of the color objects. Now the shape can delegate any color-related work to the linked color object. That reference will act as a bridge between the Shape and Color classes. From now on, adding new colors won’t require changing the shape hierarchy, and vice versa</p>
<p><strong>Real-World Analogy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Applicability</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bigger a class becomes, the harder it is to figure out how it works, and the longer it takes to make a change. The changes made to one of the variations of functionality may require making changes across the whole class, which often results in making errors or not addressing some critical side effects.</p>
<p>The Bridge pattern lets you split the monolithic class into several class hierarchies. After this, you can change the classes in each hierarchy independently of the classes in the others. This approach simplifies code maintenance and minimizes the risk of breaking existing code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Bridge suggests that you extract a separate class hierarchy for each of the dimensions. The original class delegates the related work to the objects belonging to those hierarchies instead of doing everything on its own.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although it’s optional, the Bridge pattern lets you replace the implementation object inside the abstraction. It’s as easy as assigning a new value to a field.</p>
<p>By the way, this last item is the main reason why so many people confuse the Bridge with the Strategy pattern. Remember that a pattern is more than just a certain way to structure your classes. It may also communicate intent and a problem being addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can create platform-independent classes and apps.</p></li>
<li><p>The client code works with high-level abstractions. It isn’t exposed to the platform details.</p></li>
<li><p>Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>You might make the code more complicated by applying the pattern to a highly cohesive class.</p>
<p><strong>Relations with Other Patterns</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bridge is usually designed up-front, letting you develop parts of an application independently of each other. On the other hand, Adapter is commonly used with an existing app to make some otherwise-incompatible classes work together nicely.</p></li>
<li><p>Bridge, State, Strategy (and to some degree Adapter) have very similar structures. Indeed, all of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work to other objects. However, they all solve different problems. A pattern isn’t just a recipe for structuring your code in a specific way. It can also communicate to other developers the problem the pattern solves.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use Abstract Factory along with Bridge. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by Bridge can only work with specific implementations. In this case, Abstract Factory can encapsulate these relations and hide the complexity from the client code.</p></li>
<li><p>You can combine Builder with Bridge: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Implement</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify the orthogonal dimensions in your classes. These independent concepts could be: abstraction/platform, domain/infrastructure, front-end/back-end, or interface/implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>See what operations the client needs and define them in the base abstraction class.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the operations available on all platforms. Declare the ones that the abstraction needs in the general implementation interface.</p></li>
<li><p>For all platforms in your domain create concrete implementation classes, but make sure they all follow the implementation interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside the abstraction class, add a reference field for the implementation type. The abstraction delegates most of the work to the implementation object that’s referenced in that field.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have several variants of high-level logic, create refined abstractions for each variant by extending the base abstraction class.</p></li>
<li><p>The client code should pass an implementation object to the abstraction’s constructor to associate one with the other. After that, the client can forget about the implementation and work only with the abstraction object.</p></li>
</ul>
